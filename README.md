# Handcrafted Leather Skill Transfer System

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a collaborative workshop with the **Shibaura Institute of Technology**. Our team worked on creating an innovative system to facilitate the **transfer of skills** related to **handcrafted leatherwork**, the particular chosen item is a wallet. The solution was designed to preserve and pass down traditional skills by integrating both mechanical and technological tools.

The project covers various aspects, including:
- **Costs and Materials**: Estimating the total cost of production and sourcing appropriate materials.
- **Custom Mechanical Parts**: Designing parts specifically tailored for leather crafting.
- **Technological Tools**: Implementing cutting-edge algorithms for object and emotion recognition.

## Key Features
The system integrates a variety of components to aid in skill transfer:
1. **Object Recognition Algorithm**: Utilized to identify and classify leathercraft tools and materials in real-time, enhancing the precision and efficiency of the learning process.
2. **Emotion Recognition Algorithm**: Monitors the emotional state of the learner, providing real-time feedback to adapt training based on the userâ€™s engagement and emotional responses.
3. **Custom Mechanical Parts**: Designed to replicate traditional leather crafting tools while incorporating modern adjustments to suit a wide range of learners.

As a software engineer on the team, I was responsible for developing the algorithms of the system. This includes:
- Implementing an **object recognition** algorithm to ensure the correct tools and materials are used at the right steps of the crafting process.
- Developing an **emotion recognition** algorithm to assess the userâ€™s emotional state and adjust the feedback provided by the system, aiming to improve the learning experience.

The combination of these two algorithms brings a unique aspect to skill transfer, ensuring that the traditional craftsmanship is passed on in a more personalized and effective manner.

## How It Works
- **Object Recognition**: Leveraging machine learning techniques, the system can detect and identify various leatherworking tools, providing real-time suggestions or feedback based on the detected objects.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Through facial analysis, the system evaluates the user's emotions (e.g., frustration, satisfaction) and adjusts the guidance or support given by the system to maintain a positive and productive learning environment.
